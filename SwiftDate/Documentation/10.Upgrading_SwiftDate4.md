### â†’ [Searching for old SwiftDate 4 builds?](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/milestones)

## Old Versions
- for **Swift 3.x**: Latest compatible version is 4.3.0 [Download here](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftDate/releases/tag/4.3.0). If you are using CocoaPods be sure to fix the release (`pod 'SwiftDate', '~> 4.3.0'`)
 
## Upgrading from Swift 4.x
SwiftDate 5.x is a complete rewrite of the library. While it introduces several new features a great part of the work is about a consistent naming of the functions: some was renamed while deprecated ones was removed.

**If you miss a features or you are interested in a new one create a new Issue.**

### Important Note about Default Region
In SwiftDate 4.x the default region is automatically set to local region, where all attributes are set automatically to the current device's locale, timezone and calendar.

**Since SwiftDate 5, in order to be more comply with `Date`'s default behaviour, the default region's timezone is set to GMT+0 (UTC)**.

If you want to restore the old behaviour just set it to `Region.local` just after the launch of the app.

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
	SwiftDate.defaultRegion = Region.local // set region to local device attributes
	// ... do something else
	return true
}
```

### Added/Removed/Replaced Methods
- `Date.defaultRegion` was renamed to `SwiftDate.defaultRegion` and you can both read and set it.
- `Date.setDefaultRegion(:)` was removed; use `SwiftDate.defaultRegion`'s setter.
- `TimeZoneName` is now `Zones` and its conform to the new `ZonesConvertible` protocol. All parameters (like `Region` inits function) takes now a generic `ZonesConvertible` instance: this mean you can pass one of the enum values of the zone or just an instance of `TimeZone` object (or you can conform your own class to it).
- `CalendarName` is now `Calendars` and its conform to the new `CalendarConvertible` protocol. All parameters (like `Region` inits function) takes now a generic `CalendarConvertible ` instance: this mean you can pass one of the enum values of the zone or just an instance of `Calendar` object (or you can conform your own class to it).
- `LocaleName` is now `Locales` and its conform to the new `LocaleConvertible` protocol. All parameters (like `Region` inits function) takes now a generic `LocaleConvertible ` instance: this mean you can pass one of the enum values of the zone or just an instance of `Calendar` object (or you can conform your own class to it).
- `Date/DateInRegion`: `isBetween()` function was renamed `isInRange()`
- `Date/DateInRegion`: `isAfter()` was renamed to `isAfterDate()`
- `Date/DateInRegion`: `isBefore()` was renamed to `isBeforeDate()`
- `String` extension methods `date(format:fromRegion)` and `date(formats:fromRegion)` are now replaced by `toDate(_:region)` (while similar shortcuts methods are added to parse common formats: `toISODate()`, `toDotNETDate()`, `toRSSDate()` and `toSQLDate()`.
- Removed `Int` extension `second,minute,hour,day,week,month,year` due to inconsistencies (use plural versions `seconds,minutes` etc.
- Related dates generation is now grouped under the `dateAt()` function as enum list. Therefore `nextWeekend`, `previo
- `DateInRegion`: `roundedAt()` is now replaced by `dateRoundedAt()` which now compacts paramters in a single enum.
- `DateInRegion`: `startOf()` and `endOf()` are now replaced by `dateAtStartOf()` and `dateAtEndOf()`and include support for both single and multiple units.
- `DateInRegion`: `atTime()` is now replaced by `dateBySet(hour:min:secs:options)`
- `DateInRegion`: `DateInRegion`'s static `distantFuture()` and `distantPast` are now `future()` and `past()`
- `DateInRegion`:`next(day:)` is now part of the `dateAt()` function with enum `.weekday(_)`.
- `DateInRegion`: `add(components:)` is now replaced by `dateByAdding(_:_:)`
- `DateInRegion`: `at(unit:value:)` and `at(values:keep:)` are now replaced by `dateBySet()`.
- `nextDSTTransitionDate` property is now part of the enum of `dateAt()`
- `recentDate()` and `oldestDate()` are now called `newestIn()` and `oldestIn()`
- `TimeInterval` Extension: `in(_:toDate:of:)` is now replaced by `toUnits(_:from:)` and `toUnit(_:from:)`
- `TimeInterval` Extension: `string()` is now replaced by `toString()`
- `DateTimeInterval` class is now replaced by `TimePeriod` class and its descendants
- `DateInRegion`: `dates(between:and:increment:)` to enumerate dates is now replaced by `enumerateDates(from:to:increment:)`
- `DateInRegion`: colloquial formatter `colloquial(toDate:options:)` is now replaced by `toRelative(since:style:locale:)`
- Formatting method `iso8601()` is now `toISO8601()` and other methods `to..()` was added to simplify formatting task.
- `Date/DateInRegion`: Introduced `compareCloseTo()` to compare two dates against a precision value.
- Added several shortcut methods as extensions of `String` to parse dates: `toISODate()`, `toDotNETDate()`, `toRSSDate()` and `toSQLDate()`.
- Comparison methods are now grouped by `compare()` function and a list of all available enums.
